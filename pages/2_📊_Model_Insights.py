    **How to Read This Chart:**
    - The features at the top have the most influence on the model's predictions.
    - As you can see, betting odds (like `b365a`, `b365h`) and our engineered features (like `away_avg_pts_5`) are highly predictive.
    - This gives us confidence that the model is learning from relevant information.
